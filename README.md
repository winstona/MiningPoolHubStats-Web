This is the source code for the application located at

https://miningpoolhubstats.com



**There are two ways to use this page**

1. You have to add your API key from MiningPoolHub.com. You can get your API Key from your account settings on the MiningPoolHub web page.

2. You can pass your API Key and the requested FIAT currency to convert to into the page as a variable:

_example: /index.php?api_key=THIS_IS_MY_API_KEY_&amp;fiat=FIAT_CURRENCY_CODE

3. I have also created a web page for every one to use

(For USD conversion) https://miningpoolhubstats.com/USD/API_KEY_GOES_HERE

(For EURO conversion) https://miningpoolhubstats.com/EUR/API_KEY_GOES_HERE



If this helps you in any way and you feel so inclined to donate something, I won't say no :)
